Narratia
Hey there!  
Narratia is a project I’m building step by step — it’s gonna be a cozy and interactive platform for book lovers and storytellers ....
# About the idea : 
Narratia is not just about books
It’s a space where people can :
write down their thoughts (like mini blog posts)
summarize books they read
read other people’s reviews and reflections
take part in writing or reading challenges .
I want it to be fun , simple and feel like a safe space to express and explore. 
# Project Status
This project is still under construction — I’ve started working on the backend with Flask and SQLite, and still building both frontend and backend parts.
Nothing is fully functional yet — but the vision is clear and I’m excited to keep going ..  
I’m using this space to track progress and build in public.
# Features :
User registration & login system
Post short writings 
and read book summaries
Leave and read book reviews
Competitions & challenges (with points or badges!)
Comments and interaction system
User profiles
# Tech Stack (so far) Flask (Python)
SQLite
HTML & CSS
More tools and frameworks might be added as the project grows.
# Final note
Narratia is a project I’m building with love 
It’s still in progress, but I wanted to share the idea and keep building slowly until it feels just right....
Thanks for checking it out
